## Project: Grocery in Time
Grocery in Time is a desktop application used for keeping track of groceries.
The user interacts with it using a CLI. It is written in Java and has about 4 kLoC.

## Summary of contributions
* New Feature: Added the "Add Grocery" function. 
* `add GROCEY`
    *What it does: enables users to add groceries directly into the grocery list.
    *Justification: This feature streamlines the process of managing grocery inventories, making it easier for users to keep their lists up-to-date.

* New Feature: Added the "AddMulti" function.
* `addmulti`
    *What it does: enables user to add multiple groceries into the grocery list.
    *Justification: This feature allows user to do less repeated work when adding multiple groceies at a time.

* Improvement: Amended the "Edit Expiry Date" function.
* `exp GROCERY d/EXPIRATION_DATE`
    *What it does: split into two distinct parts for enhanced usability. The first part prompts users for an expiry date when adding a grocery, while the second allows users to edit the expiry date at a later stage.
    *Justification: This modification improves the flexibility and accuracy of managing grocery expiry dates, ensuring users can easily update their groceriesâ€™ shelf life.

* Technical Update: Changed time format to LocalDateTime.
    What it does: switches the time format from string to LocalDateTime across the application.
    Justification: This update standardizes time representation within the app, enhancing data consistency and supporting more complex time-based functionalities.

* New Feature: Added an "Add Grocery Menu" function.
    What it does: prompts the user for additional details after adding a new grocery item, ensuring a comprehensive entry is made.
    Justification: This feature enriches the grocery addition process by capturing detailed information from the outset, leading to better inventory management.

* New Method: Added a method for sorting groceries by expiry date.
* `listexp`
    What it does: allows users to sort their grocery list based on the expiry dates of items, in either ascending or descending order.
    Justification: Enhances the user's ability to prioritize groceries based on expiry, helping to minimize waste and manage groceries more efficiently.

* New Method: Added a method to display groceries expiring in 3 days.
* `expiring`
    What it does: shows users a list of groceries that are expiring within the next three days and send user email notifications.
    Justification: This method significantly aids in reducing waste by alerting users to consume or replace items nearing their expiry, improving overall grocery management.
