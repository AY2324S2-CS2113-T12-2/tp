## Examples of documentation contributions

## 1. Extracts from the User Guide

### [Listing storage locations and their groceries: `listloc`](../UserGuide.md#listing-storage-locations-and-their-groceries-listloc)
View all storage locations being tracked, or the groceries stored in a given location

Format: `listloc [LOCATION]`

* `LOCATION` is an optional parameter.
    * Without `LOCATION`, all storage locations will be displayed.
    * With `LOCATION`, all groceries in the given `LOCATION` will be displayed.
* More information on storage locations can be found [here](../UserGuide.md#manage-storage-locations).

Example of usage:

* `listloc`: All storage locations are displayed.

```
>> listloc

Here's all the locations you are tracking:
- spice rack
- freezer
- cubby
```

* `listloc cubby`: All groceries in `cubby` are displayed.

```
>> listloc cubby

Viewing location: cubby
Here are your groceries!
- cheese (dairy), amount: 50, location: cubby
- pasta (carbs), cost: $2.95, location: cubby
```

## 2. Extracts from the Developer Guide

### [Grocery Management Mode](../DeveloperGuide.md#4-grocery-management-mode)

Below is a class diagram showing the associations between the `Grocery`, `GroceryList`, `Location`, and `LocationList` classes.

![Grocery, GroceryList, Location, LocationList](../diagrams/Grocery.png)


### [handleLocationCommands](../DeveloperGuide.md#43-handlelocationcommands)
![handleLocationCommands](../diagrams/handleLocationCommands.png)

`LOC` and `DELLOC` adds and deletes storage locations.
`LISTLOC [LOCATION]` shows all locations or groceries at a given location, depending on whether a location was passed.


### [Edit grocery amount](../DeveloperGuide.md#6-edit-grocery-amount)
* A `Grocery` stores its `amount` as an attribute. All `Grocery` objects are then stored in an ArrayList in `GroceryList`, which entirely handles the editing of the `amount`.

![Grocery (showing amount) and GroceryList class diagram](../diagrams/GroceryAmt.png)

* `GroceryList+editAmount()` is used to either decrease or directly set the `amount` of a `Grocery`. It takes in 2 parameters:
  1. details: String — User input read from `Scanner`.
  2. use: boolean — `true` decreases the `amount`, while `false` directly sets it.
*  To set the `amount` of a `Grocery`, the user inputs `amt GROCERY a/AMOUNT`.
* To edit the `amount` after using a `Grocery`, the user inputs `use GROCERY a/AMOUNT`.
* Our app then executes `GroceryList+editAmount()` with parameter `use = false` or `true` respectively, as illustrated by the following sequence diagram.

![useAmt sequence diagram](../diagrams/useAmt.png)

* Additional checks specific to `use` ensure that the user only inputs a valid `int`, or that the `amount` must not be 0 beforehand.
* Any exceptions thrown come with a message to help the user remedy their specific issue, as displayed by the `Ui`.
