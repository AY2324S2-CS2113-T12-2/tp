# Contributing to Grocery in Time

First off, thank you for considering contributing to Grocery in Time. Itâ€™s people like you that make Grocery in Time such a great tool.

## Where do I go from here?

If you've noticed a bug or have a question, [search the issue tracker](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/issues) to see if someone else in the community has already created a ticket. If not, go ahead and make one!

## Contributing Code

If you'd like to contribute code with a new feature or a fix, please make sure to check out [our issues](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/issues). It's a good start to see what has been reported or suggested before diving in.

### Getting Started

* Make sure you have a [GitHub account](https://github.com/signup/free)
* Submit a ticket for your issue, assuming one does not already exist.
* Fork the repository on GitHub.

### Making Changes

* Create a topic branch from where you want to base your work.
* Make commits of logical units.
* Make sure your commit messages are in the proper format (see below).
* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.

### Commit Messages

Please follow these guidelines for commit messages:

- Use the present tense ("Add feature" not "Added feature").
- Use the imperative mood ("Move cursor to..." not "Moves cursor to...").
- Limit the first line to 72 characters or less.
- Reference issues and pull requests liberally after the first line.


### Submitting Changes

* Push your changes to a topic branch in your fork of the repository.
* Submit a pull request to [the repository](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp) in the organization.
* After feedback has been given, we expect responses within two weeks. After two weeks, we may close the pull request if it isn't showing any activity.

## Coding conventions

Start reading our code and you'll get the hang of it. We optimize for readability:

* We indent using four spaces (tabs)
* We ALWAYS put spaces after list items and method parameters (`[1, 2, 3]`, not `[1,2,3]`), and around operators (`x += 1`, not `x+=1`).
* This project is built with Java, so refer to our `.editorconfig` file and Checkstyle rules for more conventions.
* Write tests for new features or fixes. We are using JUnit for unit tests.

## Reporting a bug

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/issues).
* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/AY2324S2-CS2113-T12-2/tp/issues). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

## Pull Request Process

1. Ensure any install or build dependencies are removed before the end of the layer when doing a build.
2. Update the README.md with details of changes to the interface, this includes new environment variables, exposed ports, useful file locations, and container parameters.
3. Increase the version numbers in any examples files and the README.md to the new version that this Pull Request would represent. The versioning scheme we use is [SemVer](http://semver.org/).
4. The Pull Request will be merged in once you have the sign-off of two other developers, or if you do not have permission to do that, you may request the second reviewer to merge it for you.


Thank you for contributing!
